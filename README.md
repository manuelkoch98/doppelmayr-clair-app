# clairApp

This repository contains a demo mobile application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and React Native. The app demonstrates a simple login flow and a set of tab-based screens for dashboards, tasks and profile management.

## Project structure

All source files live in the [`clairApp`](clairApp/) directory:

- `app/` – React components implementing the tab navigator and screens
- `components/` – shared UI components
- `contexts/` – context providers (e.g. authentication)
- `assets/` – images and fonts used by the application
- `scripts/` – utility scripts, including a `reset-project` script to scaffold a new blank app

The file [`clairApp/README.md`](clairApp/README.md) contains additional setup details generated by `create-expo-app`.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd clairApp
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

You can then open the project in a simulator or on a physical device using the options shown in the terminal output.

## Features

- Login screen that authenticates against a remote API
- Tab-based navigation with pages for dashboards, tasks, and the user profile
- Profile editing with the ability to update user information
- Example widgets list on the home screen

## Available scripts

From within the `clairApp` directory you can run:

- `npm run start` – start the Expo development server
- `npm run android` / `npm run ios` / `npm run web` – open the project on the corresponding platform
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint
- `npm run reset-project` – move the current example files to `app-example` and create a fresh blank `app` directory
